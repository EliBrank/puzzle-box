## Current Development Highlights
- Custom puzzle concepts
  - Directional puzzles using hidden sequences and array comparison
  - Balance puzzle comparing dynamic, stored sums
  - Pattern matching puzzle with boolean logic
- 3D modeling and animations
  - Entirely custom 3D models created in Blender
  - Custom animations triggered via Three.js
- Interactivity
  - Clickable buttons implemented via Three.js Raycaster
  - Button animations on click, as well as other dynamic animation feedback
- Responsive Design
  - Main 3D canvas useable on a range of devices/screen sizes
  - Modal content scales and moves correctly with screen size
## Future Plans
- Full 3D implementation of puzzles
  - Some 3D interaction with puzzle mechanics exists but other 2D puzzles need to be carried over
- Enhanced GLTF model
  - Baked textures would improve look and remove need for dynamic lights
  - Draco can be used to significantly reduce file size
- Sound effects
  - Audio could help to enhance immersion and improve clarity
- Code refactor
  - Change over existing functions to take greater advantage of classes, states
  - Implement local storage variables to help manage states
